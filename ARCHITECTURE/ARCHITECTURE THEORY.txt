Hereâ€™s an overview of the typical architecture for an application deployed on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk:

1. User/Client:
The user interacts with the application through a web browser or mobile app.

2. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):
Elastic Beanstalk uses an Elastic Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure availability and reliability.

3. Amazon EC2 Instances:
The application is hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, which are automatically provisioned and managed by Elastic Beanstalk. These instances run the application code.

4. Auto Scaling Group:
Elastic Beanstalk automatically scales the number of EC2 instances up or down based on the application's traffic and performance, ensuring that resources match demand.

5. Amazon S3 (Optional):
Static assets (like images, CSS, and JavaScript files) can be stored in Amazon S3 for efficient delivery to users.

6. Amazon RDS (Optional):
If the application requires a database, Amazon RDS can be used for a managed relational database service, integrated with Elastic Beanstalk.

7. Amazon CloudWatch:
Elastic Beanstalk uses Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging application performance and health metrics.

8. Security Groups:
Security Groups control the inbound and outbound traffic to the EC2 instances, providing network security.

9. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):
IAM roles and policies manage access to AWS resources used by Elastic Beanstalk, ensuring secure and controlled access.

10. Developer Interface (Elastic Beanstalk Console, CLI, or API):
Developers interact with Elastic Beanstalk through the AWS Management Console, Elastic Beanstalk CLI, or API, to deploy and manage the application.

This architecture ensures that the application is scalable, highly available, and secure, with minimal manual intervention required from the developer.
