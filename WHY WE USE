We use Amazon Elastic Beanstalk to simplify the process of deploying, managing, and scaling web applications. It allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about 
the underlying infrastructure. Elastic Beanstalk automates tasks like provisioning servers, load balancing, scaling, and monitoring, saving time and reducing complexity. It supports
multiple programming languages and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, offering flexibility and scalability. Additionally, Elastic Beanstalk provides full control over the
environment, allowing customization as needed while maintaining ease of use, making it ideal for quickly deploying and managing applications in the cloud.
