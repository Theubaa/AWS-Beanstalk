 What is elastic Beanstalk
 Amazon Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) provided by AWS that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of web applications and services. It supports several programming languages, including Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, Node.js, and PHP. With Elastic Beanstalk, developers can quickly deploy applications without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, load balancers, and databases.

Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment process, scaling, monitoring, and load balancing. It provides a managed environment where you can upload your code, and the service automatically provisions the necessary resources and manages the application's lifecycle. Elastic Beanstalk integrates with other AWS services like RDS, S3, and CloudWatch, offering a cohesive environment for running applications. It also provides developers with full control over the resources, allowing customization if needed while maintaining the ease of use.
